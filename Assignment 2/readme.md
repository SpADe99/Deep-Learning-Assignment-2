On fruit dataset, you are required to prepare one notebook that can run on google colab containing:

1) The training of a **model on the dataset as is.

2) The training of the model on the dataset after modification to improve the performance of the model.

3) The training of the model on the dataset after data-centric strategies.

4) Save the final model and load again on the notebook. Perform inference on 3 new samples (fruit data captured from your phone).

-- the model can be any model, custom or your own defined model
-- the deliverables: one notebook containing all the codes, model file (.pt file) and inference images.
